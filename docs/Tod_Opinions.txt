I space differently than most Developers and prefer using spaces for indentation. I align my code by adding three spaces, which makes the code visually aligned with the prior row on a green screen display. Tabbing is not preferred because it introduces special control characters that can disrupt alignment when viewed in different environments like RDi or Green Screen.
